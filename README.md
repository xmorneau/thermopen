________3D printings tips______________________________________________________________________

The "dessous" and the "couvercle" are the 2 parts 3D printed.

For better result, please uses theses setting on the 3D printer:
- 0.15mm Layer Height 
- 20 % to 30% infill
- support material for the "dessous" and the "couvercle".

For the 2 parts, choose the flattest faces to be the first layer to be printed.

The button was usined in aluminium with a lathe. I used metal to reduce friction between the button and the case. You can still print the button in plastic, but i'm not sure how well it will fit.
